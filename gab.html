  <h3>My K-pop Quiz is designed to ask you questions and then give you a K-pop group you're most likely to enjoy listening to. The quiz was developed using Html, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal was to create a fun, clean designed, interactive quiz while challenging my knowledge of JavaScript.</h3>

          <h2>Project Overview</h2> <br>
          <h2></h2>
          <p> DataVisualization is an interactive project created for AME394 Data Visualization. The goal was to reflect, in a real-world context, the impact of gender bias in algorithms. The project explores how humans naturally associate certain words with specific genders—mirroring the same biased processes algorithms often perform.

The quiz allows users to choose from a list of words and associate each one with a different gender. At the end, the user receives percentage-based results, showing how many of their selected words were associated with each gender, and how many were interpreted as positive or negative. These percentages are normalized to display how each gender was represented overall.
<br><br>
For example:
<br><br>
-If a user picked 4 words for men and 50% were positive, 50% negative, this splits clearly in the results.
<br><br>
-If they then picked 2 words for women and 100% were positive, this appears as 100% positive and 0% negative, shown alongside the other gender percentages.
<br><br>
The experience is designed to spark reflection about how personal choices (even unconscious ones) parallel the biases we see in algorithmic systems.

          <h2>Research and Discoveries</h2> <br>
          <p> I conducted extensive academic research into algorithmic bias, focusing on how machine learning models often absorb and reproduce gendered associations from training datasets. This research inspired the idea of allowing users to experience their own biases firsthand through interaction.
<br><br>
I wanted the project to be:
<br><br>
-Artistic
<br><br>
-Informative
<br><br>
-Introspective
<br><br>
The intention was to raise awareness about how prevalent gender bias is, both in humans and in the systems we create.

          <h2>Design Process</h2><br>
          <p> To ensure the visual design did not reinforce any gendered stereotypes, I intentionally chose a neutral, earthy color palette. This kept the interface grounded and avoided associations with traditionally gendered colors.
<br>
For my design process I used,

pen and paper for initial sketches, and

Figma for layout planning and interaction mapping.

My goals were to make the interface

clean,

neutral,

intuitive, and

emotionally balanced.

Additionally, I designed the experience to be fully responsive, so that users could participate comfortably on both desktop and mobile devices.

          <h2>Development Process</h2><br>
          <p> The project was programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and built by modifying the logic structure of my earlier K-Pop interactive quiz.
Key development features included:
<br><br>
-A dynamic tally system to calculate positive vs. negative word associations
<br><br>
-A percentage normalization algorithm to ensure each gender’s results total to 100%
<br><br>
-An interface that guides users through selecting words, associating them with genders, and viewing results
<br><br>
-Responsive design for seamless mobile use
<br><br>
Throughout development, I used browser inspection tools to adjust responsive breakpoints and refine the mobile layout. This project significantly improved my understanding of responsive UI development and JavaScript logic structuring.

          <h2>User Testing</h2><br>
          <p> I had over 30 individuals complete the quiz and provide feedback on:
<br><br>
-Ease of use
<br><br>
-Design clarity
<br><br>
-Emotional impact
<br><br>
-Accuracy or surprise in their own results
<br><br>
This provided valuable insight into how differently people interpret the same words...and how their results often revealed unconscious biases they hadn’t considered.

The collected data also served as a demonstration of how varied human associations are, further highlighting why algorithmic bias is such a challenging and important topic.

          <h2>Outcome</h2><br>
          <p> Through this project, I learned how to create something that is both interactive and meaningful, blending artistic expression with data awareness.

I gained:

A deeper understanding of gender bias in algorithms,

better JavaScript skills, especially around arrays and data processing,

stronger responsive design techniques, and

experience structuring an interactive data-driven experience.

The project successfully communicates that biases are pervasive, both in humans and in technology, and encourages users to reflect on their own assumptions.
<br><br>
My goal was to help people see their biases in action and understand how easily these patterns can appear in algorithmic systems. This project helped me grow as both a designer and developer, and affirmed the importance of intentional, ethical design.
