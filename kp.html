  <h1>CK-Pop Quiz Design and Development</h1>
  <div class="descrp">
  <h3>My K-pop Quiz is designed to ask you questions and then give you a K-pop group you're most likely to enjoy listening to. The quiz was developed using Html, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal was to create a fun, clean designed, interactive quiz while challenging my knowledge of JavaScript.</h3>

          <h2>Project Overview</h2> <br>
          <h2></h2>
          <p> The K-Pop Creation Quiz is an interactive web experience inspired by Buzzfeed-style personality quizzes. It was designed to determine which K-Pop group the user is most associated with, based on a series of fun, visually engaging questions.

This project was both a UI design and development challenge, which allowed me to explore how front-end logic and interface design can come together to create an engaging, seamless user experience. My goal was to make a quiz that was interactive, cohesive, and easy to use, while maintaining a polished visual identity.

          <h2>Research and Discoveries</h2> <br>
          <p>Before designing or coding, I conducted research on similar online quizzes to understand:

Common layout patterns

How results were displayed

What made some designs more engaging or overwhelming than others

I also watched demonstrations of different quiz-building approaches to better understand how JavaScript could handle user input and logic.

Using Figma, I created a wireframe to plan the layout, flow, and overall structure of the quiz before beginning development. This step helped me visualize how questions, answers, and results would appear on screen and how users would move from one section to the next.

          <h2>Design Process</h2><br>
          <p> A key goal in the design process was to create a clean, cohesive interface that made the quiz fun to take but not visually overwhelming.

To achieve this:

I incorporated bright, modern color accents while maintaining high readability.

Each question and answer section was clearly separated, so users could easily follow along.

The results section was styled to stand out from the rest of the quiz while still matching the overall aesthetic.

I received feedback from my professor throughout the design process to ensure that the final design was clear, user-friendly, and visually balanced.

          <h3>Outcome</h3><br>
          <p>The final design achieved a colorful yet clean interface that invites users to participate while maintaining clarity and flow. The quiz successfully tallies results and displays a result screen that is distinct but visually tied to the rest of the experience.

This project helped me strengthen both my JavaScript logic skills and UI design sensibility, particularly around handling dynamic content and maintaining aesthetic cohesion.

Through this project, I learned how interactive web elements can make design more engaging, and how attention to feedback and small visual details can elevate user experience.
