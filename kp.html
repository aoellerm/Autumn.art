  <h1>CodeDevils Website Rebranding</h1>

  <h3>The CodeDevils website serves as a primary touchpoint for prospective members, but the original design suffered from poor navigation and engagement. My goal was to create a more user-friendly and approachable interface that clearly communicates who Code Devils are, what they offer, and how to join.</h3>

          <h2>Project Overview</h2> <br>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>The CodeDevils website serves as a key form of media used to reach and interact with both prospective members and current members of the organization. The main goal was to re-design the website to be clean, concise, and inviting while improving navigability and user engagement.

For this project, I was responsible for re-designing the existing CodeDevils at ASU website into something more user-friendly and appealing to individuals looking to join. The site provides information about who the club is, what they offer, and how to get involved. Using Figma, I created a large-scale wireframe and completely restructured the layout to provide a more intuitive and cohesive experience.

          <h2>Research and Discoveries</h2> <br>
          <p>Using traffic data from GitHub’s analytics, I found that the existing website had very little foot traffic, meaning few (if any) members were being brought in through the site. To understand why, I conducted a detailed review of the current website.

I discovered:

Many hyperlinks led to pages not included in the navigation bar.

Several redundant links appeared across different pages.

Users often had to click through multiple pages to find relevant information.

From both research and personal experience as a website user, I know that when navigation is unclear or repetitive, users are more likely to leave. Since CodeDevils wanted to make a stronger, more inviting impression, it became clear that the site needed a simpler structure and better navigation flow to help users find what was most important.

          <h2>Design Process</h2><br>
          <p> I began by exploring the original CodeDevils website myself to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. Then, I met with the club president to determine which content was essential to keep in the redesign.

Using this input, I reorganized the site’s information architecture to make it more digestible and logically structured, ensuring important pages were easily accessible through the navigation bar.

Throughout the process, I went through several iterations with feedback from both CodeDevils members and ASU students to understand what would attract new users and keep them engaged.

Key steps included:

Creating wireframes in Figma to map the new layout and content flow.

Gathering user feedback to evaluate the design’s friendliness and clarity.

Making design adjustments based on input. For example, changing the landing page’s color gradient and refining the formatting of certain sections to strike the right balance between professional and approachable.

          <h3>Outcome</h3><br>
          <p> The final redesign blends key elements of the original website with a cleaner, more refined interface that’s easier for users to navigate and more inviting overall.

​

Through this project, I learned how essential user feedback is to improving usability and how small details, like redundant links or hidden pages, whichcan make a significant impact on engagement. The process also reinforced the importance of clear structure and hierarchy in creating intuitive user interfaces.
